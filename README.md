# Summary

Eat'n Split is a mini web application with a ReactJS table that shows and calculates the debt relationship between you and your friends.

## Technologies Used

In this React application, the state within components is managed using useState.
The application has a modular structure created by combining components so that the user interface is segmented. "props" is an important concept that allows us to pass external data and functions to components. Functions handle user interactions and process events. useState provides state management by updating the data inside the component. Conditional rendering is used to control whether components are displayed or not, depending on the state or conditions. Finally, event handling listens and processes user interactions, making the application interactive
